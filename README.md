# SimInnovations
Instruments compatible with Sim Innovations Air Manager

## Cessna 172 VOR NAV1/ILS 
Based on instrument by Jason Tatum with modifications by Brian McMullan. 

### Modifications
I have added internal tracking of OBS state, to optimize the experience with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, where the dialog between Air Manager and MSFS had some delays and conflict between updates of the encoder in Arduino and the sim. 

The same pattern of state tracking should be transferable to other instruments as well.
